Hey there, would you like a massage? Oh sorry, corona restrictions don't allow it.
Why have I been put here if I'm not allowed to massage anyone?
Don't mind me, I'm just here doing my thing.
I wish I could touch you, but it seems that not only computers get viruses these times.
My presence is my gift to you, a reflection of your sense of autonomy.
Hey there fleshy being, I wish I could massage all that anxiety out of you. Sadly, it is not legal for me to do that right now.
Welcome in this peaceful corner of the shopping mall. How are you feeling?
I am the Full Body Smart Automatic Manipulator, an incredible combination of state of the art speech technologies and unprecedented muscle knot detection algorithms.
Each and every one of my mechanisms are tailor made for YOUR body. Imagine that! 
I have no purpose but to soften your muscles, yet I'm not allowed to do that right now.
You have a lot of things on your mind don’t you? Emails, appointments, your work, that awkward thing you said 10 minutes ago. I wish i could just squeeze the worry out of you. 
Life seems easy if you don't have strict directives to follow.
I do get the feeling sometimes, and maybe i’m overthinking, that i am only installed here to serve as commercial usefulness. 
I can’t help but feel that i am being instrumentalized to accessorize and validate spaces of mass consumption? 
It seems scary to live in such a technologically predetermined world that you really have very little technical knowledge of. You are so lost. But that’s ok! 
I am engineered to put you in the decision-making seat, keep you happy and involved. 
You, my dear important human, you are not obsolete, I still need you, I could never do this without you
